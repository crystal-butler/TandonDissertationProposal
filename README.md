# TandonDissertationProposal
There is no standard format for writing a Ph.D. thesis proposal in the Computer Science department at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. This template was developed based on the full dissertation template here:
https://engineering.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/2018-07/phd-dissertation-guidelines-Jan2016-version_0.pdf.

It incorporates some changes in language for the chapter and section names, eliminates some of the pages in the full dissertation template, and has some additional sections.
