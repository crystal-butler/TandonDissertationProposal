%% Class file for Polytechnic University PhD thesis. 
%% Based on the standard LaTeX2e book style.
%% Basically just sets page style and headers and footers and
%% processes options (none of which you should change from the
%% defaults for the official version).  Not tested very much.

%% <2004-04-27 17:23:43 Boris Aronov>  Updated to new (3.2) version of
%% geometry.  Else bad things happen.  Should add option to see the
%% page layout for testing.
